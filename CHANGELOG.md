## [Upcoming Release]

## [1.23.1]

- Changed `Compressor`/`Decompressor` functions to accept a `NonNull<T>` rather
  than a raw pointer (#43, thanks @Dr-Emann)
- Added the following structs/functions to `libdeflate-sys` in order to support
  per-object allocators (#44, thanks @Dr-Emann):
  - `libdeflate_options`
  - `libdeflate_alloc_decompressor_ex`
  - `libdeflate_alloc_compressor_ex`
  - `libdeflate_gzip_decompress_ex`
  - `libdeflate_zlib_decompress_ex`
  - `libdeflate_deflate_decompress_ex`
- The type of `libdeflate_result` was changed from `u32` to `c_uint`. This
  shouldn't affect almost any downstream code (where `u32` == `c_uint`) but
  is more robust when compiling on alternative architectures (#44).
- The stdlib `Default` trait was implemented for `Decompressor`, `Compressor`,
  `Crc`, and `Adler32` (#45, thanks @Dr-Emann).
- `CompressionLvl`-related functions (e.g. `CompressionLevel::fastest()`),
  `Crc::new`, `Crc::sum`, `Adler32::new`, and `Adler32::sum` are now `const`
  (#46, thanks @Dr-Emann).


## [1.23.0]

- Updated libdeflate to v1.23 (#40, thanks @musicinmybrain)
- Fixed minor linting issue (#39, thanks @musicinmybrain)

## [1.22.0]

- Updated libdeflate to v1.22 (#38, thanks @musicinmybrain)

## [1.21.0]

- Updated libdeflate to v1.21 (#37, thanks @musicinmybrain)

## [1.20.0]

- Updated libdeflate to v1.20 (#34, thanks @musicinmybrain)
- Some files (e.g. benchmark inputs) are now excluded from the built crate (#33, thanks @musicinmybrain)

## [1.19.3]

- The mechanism where libdeflate is found via `pkgconfig` is now behind a `dynamic`
  feature flag, which lets downstream package users configure whether they want to
  use the in-tree copy of libdeflate or one provided from `pkgconfig` (thanks
  @joshtoik1, #32)

## [1.19.2]

- Fixed a packaging issue where libdeflate's sources weren't packaged in the cargo crate
  (thanks for reporting, @Brooooooklyn, #31)

## [1.19.1]

- Libdeflate-sys now finds libdeflate via `pkgconfig` when it's available, rather than
  using the in-tree version (#30, thanks @musicinmybrain)

## [1.19.0]

- Updated libdeflate to v1.19 (#28)
- Because the API of `libdeflater` has been (effectively) frozen for several
  years, the versioning of the library was changed to match upstream `libdeflate`

## [0.14.0]

- Updated libdeflate to v1.18 (#27)

## [0.13.0]

- Added `Adler32` struct and `adler32` helper functions, which expose libdeflate's high-performance
  adler32 checksum algorithm to library users (#26 - thanks @peterdk)

## [0.12.0]

- Updated libdeflate to v1.17

## [0.11.0]

- Updated libdeflate to v1.14 (thanks @nickbabcock)

## [0.10.0]

- Fixed `CompressionLvl::iter` not returning compression lvl 0 as
  its first element (#21)

## [0.9.0]

- Added support for compression lvl 0 (#21)

## [0.8.0]

- Updated libdeflate from around v1.6 to v1.10
