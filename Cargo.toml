[features]
# Makes libdeflate use Rust's allocator instead of the libc one.
# This is useful when Rust is preconfigured to a custom global allocator
# (e.g. pool-based, or a tracking one, or something else entirely).

# Builds libdeflate in a freestanding mode (no reliance on libc).
# This is useful for targets that don't have a C stdlib (e.g. wasm32-unknown-unknown).
